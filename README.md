# Example of channels in Phoenix Framework
> Built with the [Phoenix Framework](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix) and based on [Toby Pitman's](www.tobypitman.com) example of [CSS3 and jQuery clock](https://css-tricks.com/css3-clock/).  

> It uses the [timex](https://github.com/bitwalker/timex) date/time library.

To start your new Phoenix application you have to:

1. Clone this repo, then cd to the new directory
2. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
3. Start Phoenix router with `mix phoenix.server`
